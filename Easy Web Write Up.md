# **Easy Web** Write Up

This is a challenge from my school website about web penetration testing

## Web First Look:

When I press the button, it transfer me to 1.php

inspecting the html code, I found an odd comment line

talkingg about .bak file, .bak file is a back up file format, so my next step would be to use the button on the previous page and use the button to acess the 1.php.bak file

![image-20240823233721805](images/4.png)

simply replace 1.php to 1.php.bak

and a back up file is found, and directly downloaded

after seing **the2nd.php** lets access it via the button on the main page again

Now we are at the level 2, when we submit anything from the form the response is always the same

So finally I checked the network tab to see any **suspicious** payload activity

In the referer I found the 3rd.php file appeared, let's access that via the home page button again

![image-20240823233721805](images/11.png)

We are now at the 3rd level of the challenge, let's press the button, 

![image-20240823233721805](images/12.png)

Nothing suspicious going around, Let's check the network tab

![image-20240823233721805](images/14.png)

Yeah, there is one more php page going around (wozaizheli.php)

![image-20240823233721805](images/15.png)

now it ask us to press the button that dissapeared, well one way to brute force this is by changing the html code

![image-20240823233721805](images/16.png)

here by changing the id to something else, the script won't effect the div block so the button won't disappear

![image-20240823233721805](images/17.png)

changing the idea worked and now we can just press the button to obtain the flag
